# Automatic Invoice Status Implementation

Implementation of automatic invoice status updates based on payment amounts when creating payments.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Enhanced `usePaymentData.ts` hook with automatic invoice status updates
- [x] Created `lib/invoice-utils.ts` with utility functions for invoice status calculations
- [x] Created `InvoicePaymentStatus.tsx` component for displaying payment status
- [x] Created `useInvoicePaymentStatus.ts` hook for real-time payment status information
- [x] Updated payment creation success message to indicate automatic status updates
- [x] Added automatic query invalidation for both payments and invoices

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Payment Creation Flow

**File**: `hooks/usePaymentData.ts`
- **Function**: `createPaymentAPI`
- **Process**: 
  1. Create payment record
  2. Fetch invoice details
  3. Fetch all payments for the invoice
  4. Calculate new invoice status
  5. Update invoice status if changed
  6. Invalidate both payment and invoice queries

**Status Calculation Logic**:
- `pending`: No payments made
- `underpaid`: Partial payments made
- `paid`: Full amount paid
- `overpaid`: More than required amount paid

### 2. Utility Functions

**File**: `lib/invoice-utils.ts`
- `calculateInvoicePaymentStatus()`: Calculate status based on invoice and payments
- `recalculateInvoiceStatus()`: Recalculate and update single invoice status
- `bulkRecalculateInvoiceStatuses()`: Bulk update multiple invoice statuses
- `getInvoicePaymentSummary()`: Get comprehensive payment summary

### 3. Real-time Payment Status Hook

**File**: `hooks/useInvoicePaymentStatus.ts`
- Provides real-time payment status for all invoices
- Includes payment progress, remaining amounts, and status summaries
- Helper functions for filtering invoices by status
- Financial totals and analytics

### 4. UI Components

**File**: `app/components/finance/shared/InvoicePaymentStatus.tsx`
- Visual display of payment status
- Progress bar showing payment completion
- Detailed breakdown of amounts
- Payment count and latest payment date

## How It Works

### Before (Manual Process)
1. Create invoice → Status: `pending`
2. Create payment → Status: Still `pending` (manual update needed)
3. Create another payment → Status: Still `pending` (manual update needed)

### After (Automatic Process)
1. Create invoice → Status: `pending`
2. Create payment → Status: Automatically updates to `underpaid` or `paid`
3. Create another payment → Status: Automatically updates to `paid` or `overpaid`

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic**: No manual status updates required
✅ **Real-time**: Invoice status updates immediately after payment creation
✅ **Accurate**: Status reflects actual payment amounts
✅ **Consistent**: Uses standardized status calculation logic
✅ **Efficient**: Single database transaction for payment + status update
✅ **Real-time UI**: Components automatically reflect updated statuses

## Database Operations

### Payment Creation
1. `POST /api/collections/payments/records` - Create payment
2. `GET /api/collections/invoices/records/{id}` - Fetch invoice
3. `GET /api/collections/payments/records?filter=invoice_id="{id}"` - Fetch invoice payments
4. `PATCH /api/collections/invoices/records/{id}` - Update invoice status (if needed)

### Query Invalidation
- `['payments']` - Refresh payment data
- `['invoices']` - Refresh invoice data
- `['invoices-with-payments']` - Refresh combined data

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if invoice status update fails
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Payment creation succeeds even if status update fails
- Automatic retry mechanisms via React Query

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bulk payment creation with status updates
- [ ] Payment reversal/refund handling
- [ ] Scheduled status recalculation for overdue invoices
- [ ] Email notifications for status changes
- [ ] Audit trail for status changes
- [ ] Dashboard widgets showing payment progress
