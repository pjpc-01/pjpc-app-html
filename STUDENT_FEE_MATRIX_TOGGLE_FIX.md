# Student Fee Matrix Toggle Switch Fix

## 🔧 Issue Identified

The toggle switches in the Student Fee Matrix were not working because:

1. **Wrong Schema Mapping**: The `useStudentFees` hook was using incorrect field names that didn't match the PocketBase schema
2. **Local State Only**: The hook was using local state instead of connecting to PocketBase
3. **Missing Status Field**: The PocketBase schema doesn't have a `status` field, it uses JSON `fee_items` instead

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated PocketBase Schema Mapping**

**Before (Incorrect):**
```typescript
export interface StudentFee {
  id: string;
  students: string;
  fees_items: string;    // ❌ Wrong field name
  status: "active" | "inactive";  // ❌ Field doesn't exist
  amount: number;
}
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
export interface StudentFee {
  id: string;
  students: string;      // ✅ Student relation
  fee_items: any;        // ✅ JSON array of fee items
  amount: number;        // ✅ Total amount
}
```

### 2. **Proper Fee Assignment Logic**

The system now correctly handles individual fee item assignments:

```typescript
// Check if a fee is assigned to a student
const isAssigned = useCallback((studentId: string, feeId: string): boolean => {
  const assignment = studentFees.find(sf => 
    sf.students === studentId && 
    sf.fee_items && 
    Array.isArray(sf.fee_items) &&
    sf.fee_items.some((item: any) => item.id === feeId && item.active === true)
  );
  return !!assignment;
}, [studentFees]);
```

### 3. **Real-time PocketBase Integration**

The hook now properly connects to PocketBase:

- ✅ **Fetches data** from `student_fees` collection
- ✅ **Creates assignments** when toggling fees on
- ✅ **Updates assignments** when toggling fees off
- ✅ **Real-time sync** with database
- ✅ **Error handling** and request cancellation

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Fee Item Status Separation**

1. **Fee Management (收费项目)**:
   - Controls the **global status** of fee items
   - `active` = Available for assignment
   - `inactive` = Not available for assignment

2. **Student Fee Matrix (费用分配)**:
   - Controls **individual student assignments**
   - Each student can have their own active/inactive fee items
   - Independent of the global fee item status

### **Toggle Switch Functionality**

```typescript
// When toggle is switched ON:
assignFeeToStudent(studentId, feeId)
↓
// Creates or updates student_fees record with:
{
  students: studentId,
  fee_items: [
    {
      id: feeId,
      name: "Fee Name",
      amount: 100,
      active: true  // ✅ This fee is now active for this student
    }
  ],
  amount: 100
}

// When toggle is switched OFF:
removeFeeFromStudent(studentId, feeId)
↓
// Updates student_fees record:
{
  fee_items: [
    {
      id: feeId,
      name: "Fee Name", 
      amount: 100,
      active: false  // ❌ This fee is now inactive for this student
    }
  ],
  amount: 0
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### **1. Fee Items (收费项目)**
```
PocketBase: fees_items collection
├── id: "fee1"
├── name: "学费"
├── amount: 500
├── category: "学费"
└── status: "active"  // Global status
```

### **2. Student Fee Assignments (费用分配)**
```
PocketBase: student_fees collection
├── id: "assignment1"
├── students: "student1"  // Relation to students
├── fee_items: [          // JSON array
│   {
│     id: "fee1",
│     name: "学费",
│     amount: 500,
│     active: true         // Individual assignment status
│   }
│ ]
└── amount: 500           // Calculated total
```

## 🎮 User Experience

### **Toggle Switch Behavior**
1. **Edit Mode OFF**: Toggle switches are disabled (grayed out)
2. **Edit Mode ON**: Toggle switches become active
3. **Click Toggle**: 
   - ✅ **ON**: Fee is assigned to student (green checkmark)
   - ❌ **OFF**: Fee is unassigned from student (gray)
4. **Real-time Updates**: Total amount updates immediately
5. **Persistence**: Changes are saved to PocketBase

### **Visual Feedback**
- **Assigned Fees**: Green checkmark, included in total calculation
- **Unassigned Fees**: Gray, not included in total
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if operations fail

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Cases**
1. ✅ **Toggle ON**: Fee should be assigned to student
2. ✅ **Toggle OFF**: Fee should be unassigned from student
3. ✅ **Total Calculation**: Should update immediately
4. ✅ **Persistence**: Changes should survive page refresh
5. ✅ **Batch Operations**: Should work with multiple students
6. ✅ **Error Handling**: Should handle network errors gracefully

### **Verification Steps**
1. Open Student Fee Matrix
2. Enable Edit Mode
3. Expand a student card
4. Toggle fee items on/off
5. Verify total amount updates
6. Refresh page and verify persistence
7. Check PocketBase admin to confirm data

## 🚀 Benefits

### **For Users**
- ✅ **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual feedback
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Immediate response to changes
- ✅ **Reliable Persistence**: Data saved to database
- ✅ **Individual Control**: Each student has independent fee assignments

### **For System**
- ✅ **Proper Separation**: Global vs individual fee status
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Handles multiple students efficiently

- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized with debouncing and cancellation

## 📋 Summary

The toggle switch issue has been **completely resolved**. The system now:

1. ✅ **Correctly maps** to PocketBase schema
2. ✅ **Properly separates** global fee status from individual assignments
3. ✅ **Provides real-time** feedback and updates
4. ✅ **Persists changes** reliably to the database
5. ✅ **Handles errors** gracefully with proper user feedback

The Student Fee Matrix is now **fully functional** and ready for production use! 🎉
