# Student Fee Matrix System Guide

## 📋 Overview

The Student Fee Matrix is a comprehensive fee allocation system that allows administrators to assign fee items to students in an organized, category-based interface. This system replaces the previous sub-item complexity with a streamlined approach using individual fee items grouped by categories.

### ✅ Individual Fee Item Controls
- Toggle switches for each individual fee item
- Real-time assignment/unassignment of fees to students
- Visual feedback for assigned vs unassigned fees

### ✅ Edit Mode System
- Toggle switches are only active when "Edit Mode" is enabled
- Prevents accidental changes during viewing
- Clear visual indication when edit mode is active

### ✅ Batch Operations
- Support for batch operations across multiple students
- Efficient management of fee assignments for groups of students

### ✅ Real-time Synchronization
