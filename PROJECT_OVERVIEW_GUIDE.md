### **Workflows**
1. **Fee Item Setup**: Admin creates fee items → Programs menu → Student assignment
2. **Student Fee Assignment**: Fetch students → Load fee items → Assign via matrix → Save
3. **Invoice Generation**: Fetch fee matrix → Calculate amounts → Generate invoice → Save
4. **Payment Processing**: Parent views invoice → Choose payment method → Process payment → Generate receipt
5. **Reminder System**: Cron job check → Find overdue invoices → Send reminders → Log status
6. **Receipt Issuance**: Payment confirmed → Generate receipt → Send to parent

### **Automation Rules**
- **Invoice → AR Integration**: Every invoice creates AR entry → GL posting → Balance update
- **Payment → AR Reduction**: Payment confirmed → AR settlement → GL update → Balance recalculation
- **Reminder Automation**: Configurable schedules → Check due dates → Send reminders → Log results
- **Receipt Automation**: Payment status = confirmed → Auto-generate receipt → Send to parent
