## Implementation Plan

The payment tab has been simplified to focus on core functionality:

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Payment Display**: Simple table showing all payments with basic information
2. **Payment Creation**: Basic dialog to create payments from invoices
3. **Basic Filtering**: Status filter and search functionality
4. **Invoice Integration**: Tab to view pending invoices and create payments

### Removed Complex Features
1. **Reconciliation Logic**: Removed complex reconciliation calculations
2. **Multiple Dialogs**: Consolidated into single payment creation dialog
3. **Advanced Operations**: Removed refund, edit, and delete operations
4. **Export Functionality**: Removed CSV export and advanced reporting
5. **Complex State Management**: Simplified to basic useState hooks

### Technical Improvements
1. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
2. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling with toast notifications
3. **Loading States**: Simple loading indicators
4. **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and simplified component structure

## Relevant Files

- ✅ `app/components/finance/payment-management/PaymentManagement.tsx` - Simplified payment management component
- ✅ `types/fees.ts` - Payment and invoice type definitions
- ✅ `hooks/usePaymentData.ts` - Payment data management hook
- ✅ `hooks/useFees.ts` - Invoice data management hook

## Next Steps

1. Test the simplified payment tab to ensure it loads without errors
2. Verify payment creation functionality works properly
3. Test filtering and search capabilities
4. Gradually add back advanced features as needed

## Notes

The simplified approach prioritizes functionality over features. The component now focuses on:
- Displaying payments correctly
- Creating new payments from invoices
- Basic filtering and search
- Clean, maintainable code structure

This provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features once the core functionality is working reliably.
